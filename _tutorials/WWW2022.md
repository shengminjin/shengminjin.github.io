## Description

<p align="justify">
  Nowadays, the vast amount of existing published research works creates major obstacles regarding the traditional knowledge discovery 
  required by common research processes and other relevant tasks. However, at the same time, the increased popularity of the Open Science movement, makes 
  large amounts of scholarly metadata available through open Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs), paving the way for reliable research impact assessment 
  processes, that can alleviate the aforementioned issue. The main objective of the tutorial is to inform and educate the audience about the opportunities 
  and challenges that open SKGs create in the field of research impact assessment, presenting the respective state-of-the-art and highlighting common pitfalls.

## Impact Assessment in SKGs

<p align="justify">
  The availability of scholarly metadata cannot by itself guarantee the reliability of research impact procedures. 
  Since the landscape of the available measures for impact assessment is extremely crowded, with many of them sharing 
  similar key concepts and ideas, it is really difficult for researchers, developers, and other interested stakeholders 
  to identify which are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and which measures are more suitable for the impact 
  assessment services they target to offer. This is extremely important since it is now widely accepted that research impact 
  is a complex notion, having many, and not always correlated, aspects, and that different measures capture 
  impact from diverse perspectives, each of which could be more important in different applications. Hence the 
  selection of the appropriate research impact measures should be done with caution.

  The main objective of the tutorial is to inform and educate the audience about the opportunities and challenges that open Scholarly 
  Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) create in research impact assessment, presenting the respective state-of-the-art impact measures that can be 
  calculated, analysing their strengths, weaknesses, and proper uses, and highlighting the most common pitfalls. Although the tutorial 
  will discuss impact from various perspectives, the focus will be given on the different aspects of citation-based, scientific impact. 
  The tutorial will be concluded with the demonstration of the use of different impact measures in practical real-world applications and 
  the discussion of the current open challenges and the well-anticipated needs of the research community at large regarding reliable processes 
  for impact assessment.
